# Kinematics
This is your Swiss Army Knife for all calculations involving Projectiles or Kinamatic equations.

This python script takes as an input any 3/6 of possible inputs:

   * Time:             `-t`
   * Displacement:     `-x`
   * Initial Velocity: `-iv`
   * Final Velocity:   `-v`
   * Acceleration:     `-a`
   
    
and spits out the remaining 3 variables along with optional graphes of the moving object with the `--plot` flag
